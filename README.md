[00:06.20] I'm all alone thinking of the yesterday's blues
[00:11.19] I don't like to do but I ain't got nothing else to do
[00:37.69] 
[00:22.28] I've got a friend
[00:23.85] He's here now
[00:25.10] He lives in my head
[00:27.63] When I'm all alone
[00:29.55] I talk to my stereoman
[00:40.55] 
[00:33.97] I just can't let go
[00:35.59] It makes me sick
[00:43.59] 
[00:38.09] The only heaven I know
[00:41.01] Is heaven in the sound
[00:43.90] All I can do is close my eyes
[00:49.26] The only heaven I know
[00:51.85] My stereoman is fine
[00:55.80] He takes me everywhere I go
[01:09.30] 
[01:11.50] I'm doing this to pick up the things I dropped off
[01:16.03] I had it all or maybe I just thought I had it all
[01:40.53] 
[01:23.20] I just can't let go
[01:25.97] Would you hear me out?
[01:28.80] Tell me if I'm wrong
[01:30.18] It makes me sick
[01:38.18] 
[01:32.89] The only heaven I know
[01:35.54] Is heaven in the sound
[01:38.50] All I can do is close my eyes
[01:43.82] The only heaven I know
[01:46.60] My stereoman is fine
[01:49.42] He takes me everywhere I go
[02:02.92] 
[02:00.42] It's over my friend
[02:08.41] The storm is gone and I still think of you
[02:13.33] Yeah I still think of you
[02:16.75] You're older, grown up
[02:19.20] You won't believe I still think of you
[02:24.22] But I still think of you
[02:27.83] I just can't let go
[02:30.16] It makes me sick
[02:38.16] 
[02:32.72] The only heaven I know
[02:35.56] Is heaven in the sound
[02:38.61] All I can do is close my eyes
[02:43.80] The only heaven I know
[02:46.56] My stereoman is fine
[02:49.69] He takes me everywhere I go
[03:03.19] 
[02:54.70] The only heaven I know
[02:57.36] Is heaven in the sound
[03:00.55] All I can do is close my eyes
[03:05.54] The only heaven I know
[03:08.24] My stereoman is fine
[03:11.45] He takes me everywhere I go
